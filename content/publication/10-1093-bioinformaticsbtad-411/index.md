abstract: Screening new drug–target interactions (DTIs) by traditional experimental
  methods is costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in knowledge graphs, chemical
  linear notations, and genomic data enable researchers to develop computational-based-DTI
  models, which play a pivotal role in drug repurposing and discovery. However, there
  still needs to develop a multimodal fusion DTI model that integrates available heterogeneous
  data into a unified framework.We developed MDTips, a multimodal-data-based DTI prediction
  system, by fusing the knowledge graphs, gene expression profiles, and structural
  information of drugs/targets. MDTips yielded accurate and robust performance on
  DTI predictions. We found that multimodal fusion learning can fully consider the
  importance of each modality and incorporate information from multiple aspects, thus
  improving model performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that deep
  learning-based encoders (i.e. Attentive FP and Transformer) outperform traditional
  chemical descriptors/fingerprints, and MDTips outperforms other state-of-the-art
  prediction models. MDTips is designed to predict the input drugs’ candidate targets,
  side effects, and indications with all available modalities. Via MDTips, we reverse-screened
  candidate targets of 6766 drugs, which can be used for drug repurposing and discovery.https://github.com/XiaoqiongXia/MDTips
